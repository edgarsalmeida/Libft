## Description
**Libft** is the very first project of the 42 school curriculum. The goal of this project is to recode a set of standard C library functions, as well as other utility functions, to understand how they work under the hood. 

This custom library will be expanded and reused in almost all future C projects throughout the 42 common core (such as *get_next_line*, *ft_printf*, *so_long*, *minishell*, etc.), making efficiency, memory management, and code cleanliness crucial.

---

## Instructions

### Compilation
The project includes a strict 42-compliant Makefile that compiles the source files with the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra.

#### To compile the mandatory functions:
```bash
make
```

#### To clean up the generated object files (.o):
```bash
make clean
```

#### To remove all object files and the compiled libft.a archive:
```bash
make fclean
```

#### To force a re-compilation of the entire library:
```bash
make re
```

## Usage

To use this library in your own C projects, include the header file in your code and link the static library during compilation:
```c
#include "libft.h"
```

Compile your project along with libft.a:
```c
cc main.c -L. -lft -o my_program
```
